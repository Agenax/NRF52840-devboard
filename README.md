# NRF52840-devboard
This is the schematics of my development board based on the nordic semicon nrf52840.
It can be found here : https://oshwlab.com/Anonymousse_1/nrf52840-devboard

There are the gerber, the BOM and te cpl files.
Please note that I've not tested this board, and some components are a bit expensive if you order at jlcpcb.
I hope it will help some of you.

L.A.
